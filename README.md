# Windscribe completions for fish

Provide completions for the [windscibe-cli](https://windscribe.com/guides/linux) in [fish](https://fishshell.com).

## Installation

Install with [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) :
```fish
fisher add jduchateau/fish-windscribe-completions
```

Otherwise, you could copy the file in your fish directory (typically in `.config/fish/completions`).


## Notes

The mains sub-commands of *windscribe-cli* are working but others are not.
If you want to add them, I will be happy to merge your pull request.
