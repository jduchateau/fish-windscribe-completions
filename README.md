# Windscribe completion for fish

Provide completion for the [windscibe-cli](https://windscribe.com/guides/linux) in [fish](https://fishshell.com).

## Installation

Install with [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) (recommended) :
```fish
fisher add jduchateau/windscribe-completion
```

Otherwise, you could copy the file in your fish directory (typically in _.config/fish/completions_).


## Notes

The mains submodules of windscribe-cli are working but others are not.
If you want to add them, simply make a pull request.
